# nuki-ultra-adapter

The goal of this project is to create adapters for the smart lock ultra.

I use a `Keso 8000` Lock, that I like to use with the Nuki Ultra.

Use the models at your own risk. I am not responsible for any damage or harm caused by using the models.

#### Self-made Gear

This is a test image to see if the shape of the self-made gear fits the original gear.
It is almost perfect.
